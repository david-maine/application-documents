\subsection*{Research Intern - Oracle Labs (November 2019 - Present)}

I have recently started a research intern position at Oracle Labs. The project I am involved in aims to build an automated system that records up to date security defects in open source software.\\
My research project intends to identify the presence of security patches in application bytecode. Constructing Call Graphs and Control Flow Graphs from bytecode I am investigating statistical methods to identify key sub graphs (the security patches) within application code. This is particularly useful to allow variations in graph pattern matching and has the potential to extend to many other use cases.

\subsection*{Quantitative Analyst - Bank of Queensland (May 2018 - September 2019)}
I currently work as a quantitative analyst at Bank of Queensland. The team is responsible for monitoring and modelling credit risk to determine capital and provision holding requirements for the bank. I have built my skills in processing and validating source data, analysis and model monitoring. 

I have developed my technical skills in this role where I am exposed to Python, SAS, SQL, Bash scripting, R and Git. This position has shown me the modelling process from beginning to end and taught me the many ways and techniques to analyse, build and deploy efficiently. I am learning to apply my developer skills in a team environment where I own responsibilities and determine requirements from those around me.
