\subsection*{Research Assistant - Oracle Labs (November 2019 - Present)}

As a Research Assistant at Oracle Labs Australia I am involved in a project focused on building an automated system that reports security vulnerabilities in open source software.\\
\\
My work has consisted of building data processing pipelines, and ad-hoc analysis and visualisations of this data. This data includes relationships between consecutive library versions, dependency relationships, vulnerability relationships and paths, and issue tracker data.\\
\\
On the research side I have also been looking at automated patch detection, by comparing control flow graphs. I've looked at graph similarity scoring, and autoencoding the graph structure for easier comparison.

\subsection*{Quantitative Analyst - Bank of Queensland (May 2018 - September 2019)}
I worked as a quantitative analyst at Bank of Queensland in a team responsible for monitoring and modelling credit risk to determine capital and provision requirements for the bank. In this role I developed my technical skills, focusing on data processing, analytics and generalised linear models.\\
\\
This role was my first exposure to real world modelling challenges, showing me the process from beginning to end. I had to learn to apply my skills in a team environment, owning responsibilities and determining the best solutions considering the needs and advice of those around me.
