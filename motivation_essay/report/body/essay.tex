Dear Amsiions Office,\\
\\
I am applying for a position in the Mathematics Masters of Science program at ETH Zurich. With my Bachelor specialising in Statistics and Computer Science and Industry experience I wish to deepen my knowledge and hope to contribute to the field of mathematics.\\
\\
I was drawn to the field of mathematics for the ...\\
\\
I have taken the time and opportunities throughout my undergraduate degree to determine my professional ambitions and desires. I have experimented with positions and travelled.\\
\\
During my undergraduate degree I have worked in an industry team responsible for credit risk Statistical modelling.\\
\\
My ambition to study at ETH Zurich, and in Switzerland, stems from my desire to challenge and develop my fundemental knowledge and research skills. Switzerland is a diverse nation and I admire the inclusiveness and knowledge sharing such a society encourages. ETH Zurich has an impressive history and a reputation for being academically rigorous, particulary in the scientific fields. I would be honoured to be surrounded by the calliber of student and faculty at ETH Zurch.\\
\\
My experience in the Credit Risk Analytics team gave me early understanding of the applications of statistics and mathematics towards practical use. Though I believe it is important to understand and appreciate the use cases of mathematics, I also learnt that I did not want to follow a career of pure application and knew my passion was for learning and researching.\\ 
\\
An elegant algorithm is just as satisfying as an elegegant proof.\\
\\
I chose a dual undergraduate degree in Statistics and Computer Science for their similarity in the elagance and power of efficent and intuitive design. Mathematics is the backbone of Computer science and believe I have the rare ability to see how this relationship works. The order of mathematics. Generalizibility of Mathematcis and Computer Science.\\
\\
In my recent position as a research assistant at Oracle Labs I feel confident in a research future. I am working a project that aims to build a graph based knowledge network of security vulnerabilites in open source software. This encompasses many challenges such as analysing a large number of heterogenous sources (issue trackers, version control commits, official vulnerability databases, online forums, etc) to determine a number of homogenous properties (vulnerability, softare, versioning, etc.). In this project I am particularly interested in how to generalise NLP methods such as named entity recognition.\\
\\
I have a specific interest in Natural Language processing techniques. The concept of combining tradional machine learning with absract data structures of varying knowledge representation fascinates me. So much of the data that is available yet uninterpretable today age is text based. Text, representing human language, is also the medium that best conveys human thought. Fo this reason I see it as the most complicated, yet also most valuable data that can be analysed. I view the problem linked to a classical statistics problem; while there may always be stochastic noise or subjectivity to the problem, methods can be employed to better estimate the deterministic  I aim to build my knowledge and skills in this field to the point where I can engage with this scientific community making discoveries and make meaningful contributions myself.\\
\\
I would love to further research how abstruct structures and representations of unstructured data can be used to improve \\
\\
I intend to complete a Doctorate following from research beginning in my Masters Degree.\\
\\
In many ways language interpretation has parallel concepts to mathematics. Concepts of assignment, predicates, invariants, relationships can often be identified with a passage of text.\\
\\
I chose to apply for the Mathematics over the Computer Science program as I wish to research conceptual process, structures and techniques that can better identify these concepts within language. I would like to focuss on the underlying mathematics as I believe a robust understanding is the most effective way to make advances in the field. ETH Zurichs' reputation for focusing on the theoretical also appeals to me ...
