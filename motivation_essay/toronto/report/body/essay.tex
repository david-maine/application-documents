Dear Admissions Office,
\vspace*{10pt}

% \noindent
I am applying for a position in the Mathematics MSc program at the University of Toronto. I am a dedicated student wishing to extend upon my knowledge in the fields of Statistics and Computer Science, with the aspiration to make novel and collaborative contributions to the research community.

I hope to study at the University of Toronto for its impressive history and reputation as an academically rigorous institution. I believe I would thrive in an environment surrounded by the caliber of students and faculty at the University of Toronto. Toronto as a destination is attractive to me for postgraduate studies due to its diversity and inclusiveness. The combination of coursework and a research project in the masters program appeals to me as I wish to develop further specialised knowledge in the field of Mathematics and Statistics. I would also hope to continue my studies into the Ph.D program to develop a major thesis.

I am studying Statistics and Computer Science for my interest drawing inference based upon efficient and intuitive design. I have achieved high standards in my academics, achieving a GPA of 6.88 out of 7 to date, and a perfect 7 for the mathematics component. I have taken time and opportunities to determine my ambitions and motivations, working in industry, volunteer, and research positions. I have also undertaken fulfilling academic exchanges to Japan and France.

I have worked as a Data Analyst for a Credit Risk statistical modelling team, where I developed a strong appreciation for the applications of statistics. In my current position as a Research Assistant at Oracle Labs, I am part of a project to build a graph based knowledge network of open source software vulnerabilities. This involves analysing natural language sources such as issue trackers and commit messages to identify relevant information (vulnerabilities, software, versions), relying on techniques such as Named Entity Recognition. Complementing theoretical analysis, I can use my skills in big data analytics to build current and customised datasets efficiently.

My current research project at Oracle Labs aims to detect the presence of security patches in Java applications. My approach is to identify sub graphs representing software patches within application call and control flow graphs. Utilising statistical techniques is advantageous over exact pattern matching to identify sub graphs with small variations in comparison to the search graph, which occur due to modifications of the surrounding application code. Within the project I am exploring techniques such as Graph Neural Network models and spectral graph theory. These approaches have the potential to extend to similar problems in program analysis, such as identifying bad practice or malicious patterns. Edge prediction also has the potential to predict dynamic calls traditionally only available at runtime.

In the future I am interested in investigating open problems in the field of Graph Neural Networks. One limitation is the convolutional approach, where the stacking of multiple layers results in over smoothing of the graph dataset, preventing a deep structure. Another challenge is the extension of Graph Neural Network models to dynamic graphs, where the model can adapt to changing nodes and relationships. I have also enjoyed studying Bayesian statistical theory and computational methods, and am interested to understand if the combination of likelihood free inference with Graph Neural Networks is beneficial. I am applying for the Mathematics rather than the Computer Science program, as I wish to focus on the fundamental theory and concepts. I believe creative mathematics is the most promising approach to make significant advancements in these modelling techniques.

I am a motivated and curious individual who would capitalise on every opportunity University of Toronto has to offer. I believe my background, abilities, and character makes me ideally suited for your Masters of Science program. Thank you for considering my application.
